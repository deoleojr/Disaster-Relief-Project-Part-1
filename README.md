## Synopsis
This project involves using classification methods to locate displaced persons living in makeshift shelters following the 2010 earthquake in Haiti. High-resolution geo-referenced imagery was used to identify temporary shelters made with blue tarps. The goal is to build and evaluate models to effectively search the images and locate these shelters to assist rescue workers.
